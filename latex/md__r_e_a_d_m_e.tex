No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

Start by not writing any code.


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


The possibilities are endless.

\subsubsection*{Building the Application}

Now that you have not done anything it\textquotesingle{}s time to build your application\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


Yep. That\textquotesingle{}s it. You should see the following output\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Deploying}

While you still have not done anything it\textquotesingle{}s time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


It\textquotesingle{}s that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\end{DoxyCode}


I know right?

\subsection*{Contributing}

You don\textquotesingle{}t.
