# No Code
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dvdmuckle/nocode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvdmuckle/nocode)

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. It is also blazing fast. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.  

```


```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing nothing you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless. The only limit is your imagination.

### Building the Application - Worlds first noCodeArchitecture

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```
 
```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```




```

#### Running the test suite

No code uses the no tests framework. Simply execute:

```

```

If nothing was outputted, or the `$?` gives a 0 return value, then all tests were successful.

```

```

### Testing the application

To run full tests of the application:

```

```

To run end to end tests of the application:

```

```

### Automated Testing the code

Now it' time to add some tests to your code to ensure it works the way you think it should. 

```

```

Now your code is safe and bug-free. Simple, right ?

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.
 
```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know, right?

### Fault Tolerance 

Since there is nocode, that runs nowhere, we inherently have Fault tolerance. Have a look at the following: 

```

```

I know, this is revolutionary!

### Disaster recovery
When a catastrophic disaster event occurs, the system continues in its nocode norun policy. This can be implemented in all cloud and non-cloud platforms in existence and yet to be invented.

Here is an example nocode on Microsoft Azure. Same can be achieved on AWS Cloud.

```

```

Take a moment to absorb that.

## Testing
Now that you do not have any tests, run the tests.

```

```

Yep. That's it. By n ow you should be able to see nothing.

```

```


### Troubleshooting guide

For every issue try,

```

```
It should resolve it immediately.


### Dockerize No Code
Build an image. It will work even without Docker.
```
docker build . > /dev/null 2>&1
```

That's it.

To make entirely sure nocode is working, it is recommended that you turn off your computer.
